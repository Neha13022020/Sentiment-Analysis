# Sentiment-Analysis
NLP Project


First I took the Amazon review to train the model. 

Then did the text preprocessing on the data, used average word2vec for vectorization and trained the model with 90%+ AUC. 

After that scrapped reviews from ETSY.com website for testing. 

Then at last created web API to show the project.
